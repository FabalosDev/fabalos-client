      This is a one-man dev lab focused on building smart, resilient systems that solve real problems.

    <!-- 🔸 Value Proposition -->
    <p class="text-soft leading-relaxed">
      Whether it's product tagging, content ops, or full system orchestration —  
      I build scalable workflows with clarity, purpose, and a bit of creative fire.
