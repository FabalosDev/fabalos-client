    <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-5 space-y-3 text-slate-400">
      <li>
        <span class="text-slate-200 font-medium">Builds and maintains automation workflows</span> using tools like Make.com, n8n, and GPT to remove repetitive manual work while keeping humans in control of key decisions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-slate-200 font-medium">Structures data, content, and processes</span> so information flows cleanly between apps, teams, and environments instead of getting stuck in inboxes and spreadsheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-slate-200 font-medium">Focuses on durability and transparency</span>, so every automation can be inspected, versioned, and extended as your operations grow.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Who This Is For</h2>

      <li>
        <strong class="text-slate-200">Operators, founders, and teams</strong> who rely on digital workflows (content, e‑commerce, client services, operations) and want them to be reliable instead of fragile.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="text-slate-200">Builders and technical stakeholders</strong> who care about clear architecture, sensible naming, and well-documented systems rather than “black box” automations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Anyone who prefers thoughtful, systems-first automation over one-off hacks that break the moment the business changes.
